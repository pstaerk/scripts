# Fractal Noise Generator

This project was just a quick test to see whether or not I could quickly write a fractal-like noise generator, much like Perlin Noise etc.
The programming is pretty sloppy for now, but perhaps I will later build on the idea and write some more elaborate graphics generating code on this base.

## Idea:
Use noise of different frequencies overlaid on top of each other to generate curves with interesting texture.
This might be used to make computer drawn lines more "squiggly" and could even be used for terrain generation.
